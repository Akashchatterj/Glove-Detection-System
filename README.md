## ⚠️ Challenges & Limitations

### What Didn't Work / Needs Improvement

1. **Background Confusion** 🎭
   - 19-81% confusion with cluttered backgrounds
   - Complex industrial environments cause false positives
   - **Solution:** Hard negative mining, higher confidence threshold

2. **Occlusion Issues** 🖐️
   - Partially visible hands sometimes missed
   - Overlapping hands cause detection failures
   - **Solution:** Multi-scale training, attention mechanisms

3. **Small Object Detection** 🔍
   - Distant hands (small bboxes) harder to detect
   - Resolution loss at 416×416 input size
   - **Solution:** Increase input size to 640×640, use larger model

4. **Similar Appearance Confusion** 👀
   - Worn/dirty gloves look similar to bare skin
   - Dark gloves in shadows hard to distinguish
   - **Solution:** Add lighting-specific augmentation, collect more edge cases

5. **Limited Training Time** ⏱️
   - 50 epochs may be insufficient for optimal performance
   - **Solution:** Train for 100-200 epochs for production deployment
